Description: An extension of the Exreme Learning Machine (ELM) method to kernel
    logistic regression. A simple approximation of the
    logistic function converts the iterative reweighted least squares
    solution to a linear solution. Package also include an extension
    of ELM to (robust) least-squares support vector machine (classifier)
    as well as the original ELM.
